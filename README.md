# Prideful Animals

Makes heart particles spawn with random pride flags. Gay sheep!

### Why isn't this a resource pack?

It's true that you can easily change textures or new textures to particles via resource pack. However, with the way Minecraft's particle generator works, it would select a random flag for each individual particle. This doesn't look good, and I wanted each time you feed a mob to spawn 10 hearts of the same flag. So, this is packaged as a mod to have some extra logic over which textures are selected.
